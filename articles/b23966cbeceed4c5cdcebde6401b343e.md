I was fortunate enough to meet up with Wendell from Level 1 Techs (he’s not my dad) and after extensive testing, we were able to come up with a system that meets my needs for both *video editing* and *gaming*. And I’ve finally built it! (Almost… but we’ll get to that).

This is my brand new office PC.

I don’t know if I’ve told you guys this or not, but I like to have a naming scheme for my devices. My laptop is Sisko, my phone is Adama, my server is Picard… **are noticing a trend here?**

So I was thinking about naming this machine *D’argo,* because, well, **Farscape** might be the greatest SciFi series ever…

But that’s neither here nor there, let’s talk about the heart of machine; the motherboard. It’s an X370 SLI Plus ATX board from MSI that Wendell hooked me up with. It’s by far the nicest motherboard I’ve ever owned. It has tons of expansion capability, plus room for a bunch of storage, with an M.4 slot as well as 6 SATA ports.

It’s an AM4 socket board, and that’s where we get to talkin’ about the processor; the *Ryzen 7 1800X* 8-core clocking in at 3.6 GHz. it can turbo out of the box up to 4GHz. This processor didn’t come with a stock cooler, so that’s why I bought the MasterLiquid 120 from CoolerMaster. It’s understated, yet definitely adds to the character of the machine. 

I outfitted this build with a pair of 8GB G.Skill Ripjaw 5 Series DDR4 memory modules (for a total of 16Gb). They clock in at 3200 Mhz and I’m pretty pleased, though I think I’ll be adding another set of these to the build before I’m completely satisfied.

Powering it all is a 550W EVGA SuperNOVA 80+ Gold Modular power supply that has helped tremendously with cable management. I can leave out the power cables I don’t need and it keeps the inside of my case looking sane…

Oh, yeah… the case. The case is the Fractal Design Define R6 Midtower with a Tempered Glass side panel. It’s quite snazzy. I chose this one because of how striking it looked when I saw it in person at the Level 1 headquarters.

Now you might be wondering, where’s the GPU? Is it integrated? No. I’m using my old Nvidia GTX 970 until I can pick up a Vega 56 for a reasonable (or at the very least a NOT INSANE) price.

Shipping was a breeze, except for with Newegg which always takes nearly two weeks to ship stuff to me for some reason. On the flip side, OutletPC was stellar, they were the first packages to arrive, everything worked flawlessly, and shipping cost was reasonable.

The build process was super easy this go-around. I had absolutely no issues whatsoever (except figuring out which hardware I was supposed to use for the CPU cooler. Cause that came with so much extra hardware. Oh my god.)

I’ve been using D’argo for a few weeks, and edited the last three videos on it. I have to say I’m quite pleased, though there definitely is room for improvement. A new graphics card and more RAM are in order, as well as a new distro? We’ll see how things go. You can find a link to this build on PCPartsPicker in the description.

But I want to hear from you. Have you built a new PC recently? How should I stress test this machine? Hit me up on Twitter @TheLinuxGamer. If you like the work that I do you can support the show over on Patreon or Liberapay. Or you can hit that subscribe button and as always, thanks for watching!
