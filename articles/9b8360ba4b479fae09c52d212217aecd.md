I put my heart and soul into The Linux Gamer. I try my best to make content that's fun, thoughtful, and informative. At this point, The Linux Gamer has become what amounts to a part-time job. And I already work full-time. If you like the work that I do, maybe toss a buck or two my way. It all helps! Maybe soon, with your help, I'll be able to focus primarially on The Linux Gamer.

##You're asking for money?
If you like what I do, you can always support TLG by sharing videos, talking about the channel with your friends, and, of course, disabling AdBlock.

But yeah, if you want to support the show with cold hard cash, you can pledge to my [Patreon Campaign](http://patreon.com/thelinuxgamer). There are a few different pledge tiers you can choose from (if the warm, fuzzy feeling of participating in crowdfunding campaigns isn't enough of a reward on its own.)

My current patrons and I have tried to make the reward tiers worth your consideration. I hope you find the rewards on offer to be of some value.
