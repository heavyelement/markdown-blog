#Markdown Guide
##Simple Styling
You can **bold** and *italicize*
>```
>**bold**
>```
>**bold**
>
>```
>*italicize*
>```
>*italicize*

<br>
##Horizonal Rules
You can create a horizontal rule like so:
>```
> Example text
> ******
> More example text
>```
>
> Example text
> ******
> More example text

<br>
##Lists
You can create lists easily
>```
>* Item 1
>* Item 2
>```
>
> * Item 1
> * Item 2
>
>
> ```
> 1. Item 1
> 2. Item 2
> ```
> 
> 1. Item 1
> 2. Item 2

<br>
##Headlines
Creating headlines is easy
>```
>#Title of your post
>```
>#Title of your post
>
>```
>###Post Subtitle
>```
>###Post Subtitle
>
>```
>##Product Title
>$799
>```
>##Product Title
>$799
>
>```
>####Post Section
>```
>####Post Section

<br>
##New Lines
If you want to create a new line, make sure that your lines are separated like this:
>```
>This is one line of text
> 
>This is another line of text
>```

**NOTE:** Without an empty line between them, there won't be a new line created.

<br>
##Links
Create a link by encapsulating text like this:
<blockquote><p><pre><code>If you're looking for a link, [look no further](http://perryshomedesign.com)</code></pre></p>
If you're looking for a link, <a href="http://perryshomedesign.com">look no further</a>.
<p></p>
</blockquote>
**NOTE:** Remember that **b**rackets come before **p**arenthesis. In other words, **B** comes *before* **P** in the alphabet.

<br>
##Images
You can include an image like this:
>```
>![Give the image a name](http://example.com/image.jpg)
>```

It looks very similar to a link. The difference being the "**!**"

You can also reference relative paths (as in images on our server).
>```
>![Perry's Logo](/res/logo-black.svg)
>```
>![Perry's Logo](/res/logo-black.svg)

<br>
##HTML Elements
You can use HTML elements in your markdown, but note that actual markdown styling won't be applied to elements within HTML tags. Example:

>
>```
>*This text IS italic*
><div>*This text IS NOT italic because it's in a <div> tag*</div>
><br>
>**This text is bold**
><p>**This text IS NOT bold because it's in a <p> tag**</p>
>```
>
>*This text IS italic*
><div>*This text IS NOT italic because it's in a &lt;div&gt; tag*</div>
><br>
>**This text is bold**
><p>**This text IS NOT bold because it's in a &lt;p&gt; tag**</p>

<br>
##Call to Action
###The Easy Way
If you want to create a call to action button, it *must be the very last item in a document*. It works like every other link, except it's the **LAST** line:

<blockquote>
<p>
<pre>
<code>
[This won't be a button](http://perryshomedesign.com)
[This will be a button](http://perryshomedesign.com)
</code>
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://perryshomedesign.com">This won't be a button</a>
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://perryshomedesign.com" style="text-align:center;">This will be a button</a>
</p>
</blockquote>

###The Hard Way
If you want to put a call to action button somewhere other than the end of a post, follow these instructions:

>```
>Here is some content
><div>
>  <p>
>    <a href="http://example.com">Call to action</a>
>  </p>
></div>
>###Here is MORE content after the fact
>```

<blockquote>
<div>
<p>
Here is some content
</P>
<p>
<a href="#" style="text-align:center">Call to action</a>
</p>
<h3>
Here is MORE content after the fact
</h3>

</div>
</blockquote>

**NOTE:** You don't need to make something a headline after you make a button. This is for illustrative purposes. Once you close your HTML content, you can resume markdown
