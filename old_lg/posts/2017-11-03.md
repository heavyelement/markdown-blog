#Announcing The "Why I Use Linux" Project

It's pretty simple:

  1. Make something that explains your choice to be Linux user (and enthusiasm for it).<br>**For example:**
    * Make a *YouTube video* talking about Linux
    * Build a *gadget* that conveys your love for Linux
    * Design a *3D-printed MacGuffin* that shares your passion for Linux
    * Do a *claymation short film* featuring Tux
    * Engineer an *app* that helps people become Linux users
    * Write a *blog post* that talks about Linux and it's virtues
    * Be creative and, most importantly, **HAVE FUN!**
  2. Have your entry completed on or before *November 24th*
  3. Submit your entry on Twitter<sup>&Dagger;</sup> with the **#WhyIUseLinux**
  4. Tune in to [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/events/VmaDLiZpSj6TzjaLIcsKSQ) on the 25th where I review each entry (I may have a special guest)

You can make your project alone or in teams. You can build it publicly or in solitude. Do something awesome and let's have fun!

<sub>&Dagger; You may also submit your projects to [my email address](mailto://thepixeltux@gmail.com). Put #WhyIUseLinux in the subject line.</sub>
