Markdown Blogging
=================

I built this simple markdown blogging site based on the Parsedown project. You can see a live demo running over at [pixeltux.com/](http://pixeltux.com/).

If you would like to review the code or fork this repo, feel free! It's GPL licensed.

## Defining a user:
Before you can start posting, you'll need to manually define the first user. Create `users.json` in `resources/cfg/`.

```
{
    "username" :{
        "uname": "username",
        "fname": "Full Name",
        "pword": "$2y$10$8skal8389osdc/nujakeuncsda8.3899mcasdakj",
        "image":"/img/users/Gardiner.png"
    }
}
```

## What this is:

What's here almost completely what is on my website. It was designed by me, for me. If you want to help expand this project, let me know!
